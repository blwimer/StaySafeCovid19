### Project Goals
An application to direct when and where it is time for a person to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. This application will be designed to serve anyone interested in and soon to be eligible for the vaccine. As well as vaccine information, this application will also include up-to-date Covid-19 information. As of right now, we are creating this application only for the state of Alabama.

### Approach
* Tools/APIs/Frameworks
  - We used React Native as our main framework to create this application. However, we learned to use a lot of extra libraries to make our application more user accessible such as React Native Elements. To create this application, we also often used Expo Go and Snack as simulators to see if we were creating the application how we wanted to. For most of the information from our application, we directed the user to the same information on Alabama's Public Health Website; however, their website was not as efficient as it should have been and lagged a lot. For our Logins, we used Firebase as the database for usersz who registered an account within the application. We could not add the function of a Forgot Password screen though because with this, we would have needed to purchase this funcytionality from Firebase.

### Description of experience 
  -Our app mainly have three functional part, user part, COVID-19 part, as well as the vaccine part.
  
1) user part.
User can register an account using their name, email, gender, phone number information.
After registion, user can login with the password and email address.
When they forget the password, they are able to revovery their password by email.

2) COVID-19 part
User can access COVID self accessment page to give themselves a self COVID check based on the symptoms.
Also when user click on the COVID INFO page, user can know some normal COVID-19 symtoms, some advice to avoid COVID.
When user want to check the case number of their county, they can access the covid case map page, search or click the county name. Then they can check the case number. 

3) Vaccine part
user can use the vaccine self accessment to check if they are feasiable to take the vaccine base on their job type, age, health history.
Also user can click on the vaccine map page to check the nearest place to get the vaccince.
If user have any concern about which type vaccine they should take, what is the side effect, they can get the correct info when they click vaccine info page.
