### Project Goals
An application to direct when and where it is time for a person to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. This application will be designed to serve anyone interested in and soon to be eligible for the vaccine. As well as vaccine information, this application will also include up-to-date Covid-19 information. As of right now, we are creating this application only for the state of Alabama.

### Approach
* Tools/APIs/Frameworks
  - We used React Native as our main framework to create this application. However, we learned to use a lot of extra libraries to make our application more user accessible such as React Native Elements. To create this application, we also often used Expo Go and Snack as simulators to see if we were creating the application how we wanted to. For most of the information from our application, we directed the user to the same information on Alabama's Public Health Website; however, their website was not as efficient as it should have been and lagged a lot. For our Logins, we used Firebase as the database for usersz who registered an account within the application. We could not add the function of a Forgot Password screen though because with this, we would have needed to purchase this funcytionality from Firebase.
