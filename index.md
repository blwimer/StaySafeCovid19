## StaySafe Covid Alert

### Project Goals
An application to direct when and where it is time for a person to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. This application will be designed to serve anyone interested in and soon to be eligible for the vaccine. As well as vaccine information, this application will also include up-to-date Covid-19 information. As of right now, we are creating this application only for the state of Alabama.
